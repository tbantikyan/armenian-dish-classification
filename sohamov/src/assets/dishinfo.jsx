        <p className="dish-info">
            <span className="bold light">Basturma</span>, historically known as aboukh, is cured meat renowned for its
            unique spice coating. Although typically prepared from beef, versions of the dish can be found across 
            different regions made with various meats and spices.<br/>
            <br/>
            The dish is prepared by coating the meat with a mixture of garlic, paprika, fenugreek, and
            other aromatic spices in a blend known as chaman (Armenian: <span className="italic">չաման</span>). The meat
            is hung to air-dry, during which the spice coating becomes a red shell.<br/>
            <br/>
            Basturma is enjoyed in a variety of contexts. It can be paired with bread, cheese, and olives, served as a 
            part of sandwiches and wraps, or added to other dishes. Most commonly, the cured meat is cooked into an 
            omelet-like dish.

    'Գաթա (gata)':
        <p className="dish-info">
            <span className="bold light">Gata</span> is a delicious treat made from rich, flaky dough and a sweet
            filling. The pastry can come in a variety of forms, though it is typically shaped like a round cake or

            <br/>
            Gata is prepared with a mixture of nuts, commonly walnuts or almonds, sugar, and butter. The mixture is rolled
            into the dough such that it creates layers of filling within the pastry. The dough is well-kneaded to ensure
            the pastry is light and airy.<br/>
            <br/>
            The pastry holds significance in Armenian culture and can be found decorated with designs of
