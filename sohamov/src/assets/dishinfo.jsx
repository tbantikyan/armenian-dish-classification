            <span className="bold light">Basturma</span>, historically known as aboukh, is cured meat renowned for its
            unqiue spice coating. Although typically prepared from beef, versions of the dish can be found across 
            different regions made with various meats and spices.<br/>
            <br/>
            The dish is prepared by coating the meat with a mixture of garlic, paprica, fenugreek, and
            other aromatic spices in a blend known as chaman (Armenian: <span className="italic">չաման</span>). The meat
            is then hung to air-dry, during which the spice coating becomes a red shell.<br/>
            <br/>
            Basturma is enjoyed in a variety of contexts. It can be paired with bread, cheese, and olives, served as a 
            part of sandwiches and wraps, or added to other dishes. Most commonly, the cured meat is cooked into an 
            omelet-like dish.
