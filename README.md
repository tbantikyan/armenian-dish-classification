# armenian-dish-classification
## About 
I got the idea to make this app after the third or fourth time a friend reached out to me with hopes that I could identify an Armenian dish they had eaten at a gathering or restaurant. Already intrigued by machine learning and image analysis, I thought it'd be a fun project to create a web app that could classify popular Armenian cuisine.

I gathered a dataset of nearly one thousand images of dishes and trained a model with a success rate of roughly **98%** in testing. I developed a functional and visually appealing web app with React to allow anyone to play around with the model. Overall, the project was enjoyable and a wonderful learning experience.
