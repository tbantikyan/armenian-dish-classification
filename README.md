# armenian-dish-classification
## About 
I got the idea to make this app after a few instances of friends reaching out to me with hopes that I could identify an Armenian dish they had eaten at a gathering or restaurant. Intriguied by machine learning and image analysis, I thought it'd be a fun project to create a webapp that could classify staples of Armenian cuisine.

I gathered a dataset of nearly one thousand images of dishes and trained the model with a success rate of roughly *98%* in testing. I developed a functional and visually appealing webapp with React to allow anyone to play around with the model. Overall, the project was enjoyable and a wonderful learning experience.
